People have been spending an increasing amount of time on Youtube videos, especially during the Coronavirus pandemic where people have to stay at home. In the meantime, a lot of people become YouTubers and making money from sharing their videos.

In this analysis, we are interesting in what categories of videos are popular on Youtube over time, looking at the view counts of videos in different categories among different countries (US, Great Britain and Canada). In addition, we will also investigate the relationship between views and the characteristics of some attributes(titles, tags, and descriptions) to analyze how a video can attract more views.

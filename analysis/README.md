**Nov 15** *(From Kristy):* \n
I loaded all three datasets into a single dataframe, with a new column called 'country'. I also replaced the 'categoryId' with the 'category' getting from the json file on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset). 
In addition, I also created a dataframe called 'df_lastdate' which contains the video statistics with the lastest trending date.
